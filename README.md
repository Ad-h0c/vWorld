# Vworld

This project demonstrates a basic Metaverse project. Metaverse is a huge thing in the web3 domain. Here, you can buy and sell lands as NFTs. 

In contrast to some unlimited lands in metaverse project, I have developed this project with fixed number of lands.

Here you can buy, mint, and sell lands with the seller set price. But all lands start with fixed price.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
